# 💻 SaaS Revenue and Customer Health Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This Power BI project simulates a real-world SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) analytics dashboard, designed to monitor recurring revenue, customer churn, and retention metrics. Although inspired by the HubSpot platform design, the data and report were self-created for learning and demonstration purposes only.

The dashboard helps SaaS product teams, CFOs, and customer success managers visualize customer health and revenue performance with clarity and agility.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Visual Design)
- Excel (Synthetic Data Generation)
- Power Query (Data Cleaning & M Transformation)

## 🗃 Dataset Description
- Simulated SaaS KPIs from 2021–2024
- Columns include: `Month`, `Churn Rate`, `Net Retention`, `MRR`, `ARR`, `Active Customers`, `New Customers`
- Created in Excel based on SaaS industry benchmark patterns

## 📈 Dashboard Features
